# learningToCode
This is a repository for the codes I write while I am learning how to code.
I will start with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which I am learning at the moment.
More may be added later as I learn new langauages.
Comments within my code are intended to help me learn and remember the techniques and syntax that I use.
